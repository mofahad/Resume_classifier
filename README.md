# Resume_classifier

A Flask-based API for classifying resumes into predefined job roles using machine learning models. This project provides a simple yet powerful solution for HR teams or recruitment platforms to streamline the resume screening process by automatically categorizing resumes into relevant job roles. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques, such as TF-IDF for feature extraction, and machine learning algorithms like logistic regression, this API efficiently handles text data and returns accurate predictions.
